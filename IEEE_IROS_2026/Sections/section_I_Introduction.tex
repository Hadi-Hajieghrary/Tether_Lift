Cooperative aerial transport---where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) jointly carry a payload via cable suspensions---extends capacity, workspace, and fault tolerance beyond single-platform limits. These systems are inherently safety-critical: cable slack, excessive swing, vehicle tilt, inter-agent collisions, and disturbances can each cause loss of controllability or payload instability. Realizing $N$-quadrotor cooperation therefore requires controllers that respect the nonlinear manifold structure, operate without centralized coordination, and systematically mitigate dominant failure modes.

Lee, Sreenath, and Kumar~\cite{lee2010geometric, sreenath2013geometric} formulated cable-suspended transport on the full nonlinear configuration manifold, achieving almost-global stability free of Euler-angle singularities. Extensions~\cite{lee2018geometric} added anti-swing regulation of pendular cable dynamics. Sharma and Sundaram~\cite{sharma2023geometric} proposed a tractable geometric controller for multi-UAV payload transfer without link information, and Sun et al.~\cite{sun2025agile} demonstrated agile cooperative cable manipulation with online kinodynamic planning. However, these controllers assume centralized state knowledge or full-state payload feedback: every quadrotor must know the number of cooperating agents~$N$ and the payload mass~$m_L$, or all peers' states---impractical when communication is unreliable.

\textit{Decentralized and adaptive methods.}
Consensus-based formation controllers and distributed optimization rely on linearized dynamics and Euclidean error metrics that forfeit global stability during large-angle maneuvers---precisely when guarantees matter most. Wang et al.~\cite{wang2024automultilift} proposed Auto-Multilift, a distributed learning framework tuning MPC cost functions online for cooperative load transport, but it relies on optimization-based MPC rather than geometric control and lacks Lyapunov stability certificates. Concurrent learning~\cite{chowdhary2010concurrent, chowdhary2013exponentially} enables convergence without persistent excitation (PE) via stored data, which is particularly relevant because cooperative hover provides insufficient excitation. However, existing concurrent learning applications remain limited to centralized, single-vehicle settings.

Cable-suspended transport imposes real-time state constraints: cables must remain taut, cable angles must be bounded, swing rates must be limited, and collisions must be prevented. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)~\cite{ames2017control, ames2019control} enforce such constraints via online QPs that minimally modify a nominal controller. Yang and Xie~\cite{yang2025robust} combined CBFs with disturbance estimators for single-quadrotor cable-suspended payload safety, showing that disturbance-observer CBFs reduce conservatism under model uncertainty. However, integrating CBFs with geometric controllers on nonlinear manifolds — while preserving Lyapunov certificates — remains open. The challenge intensifies in decentralized multi-agent settings where coupled constraints and attitude stability must coexist.

Most geometric transport results assume rigid cables and perfect state feedback. Real cables exhibit compliance, wave propagation, and slack-to-taut transitions that significantly affect behavior~\cite{williams2009dynamics}. Onboard estimation must fuse noisy IMU, GPS, and barometer via nonlinear filters~\cite{sola2017quaternion}, and wind introduces unmodeled forces. The robustness of geometric cooperative controllers to these conditions remains largely uncharacterized. In summary, no existing framework simultaneously provides geometric manifold control, decentralized adaptive estimation without PE, and runtime safety certification for multi-UAV cable transport.

A central principle in safety-critical engineering is early identification and systematic mitigation of dominant hazards~\cite{STPAleveson}. Rather than designing a monolithic controller and verifying safety post hoc, each GPAC layer addresses a specific transport hazard: anti-swing regulation stabilizes pendular modes, adaptive estimation mitigates load uncertainty, the ESO compensates disturbances, and the CBF layer enforces constraints as a runtime supervisor. The hierarchical multi-rate structure with timescale separation limits fault propagation; the fully decentralized implementation eliminates single points of failure~\cite{koopman2017autonomous}. Table~\ref{tab:failure_modes} in Section~\ref{sec:results} validates this mapping with measured data.

The GPAC architecture decomposes the cooperative transport problem into $N$ identical single-agent subproblems via a key insight: each quadrotor independently estimates its payload mass share $\hat{\theta}_i \approx m_L/N$ from local cable measurements, and the combined forces automatically sum to the correct total:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^{N} F_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{\theta}_i \cdot u \;\longrightarrow\; m_L \cdot u,
  \label{eq:force_convergence}
\end{equation}
where $u := g\,e_3 + \ddot{p}_L^d$ is the common payload acceleration demand, computed identically by every agent from the shared reference. This implicit coordination eliminates the need for a centralized coordinator, payload or cable state exchange, consensus protocols, or knowledge of the payload mass. The specific contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
  \item \textbf{Decentralized geometric control on $\SEthree\times(\Sph^2)^N$.} The decentralized controller for multi-UAV cable transport operates directly on the nonlinear manifold without linearization, requiring no payload state, cable state, or adaptive-parameter exchange.

  \item Each agent estimates $\hat{\theta}_i \to m_L/N$ from local cable tension and direction with exponential convergence---even during near-hover conditions where classical adaptive laws fail.

  \item A modular safety layer enforcing cable tautness, angle, tilt, swing rate, and collision constraints with input-to-state safety (ISSf) guarantees. Theorem~\ref{thm:compatibility} proves the CBF-induced modifications preserve almost-global exponential attitude stability on $\SOthree$.

  \item High-fidelity Drake-based simulation with bead-chain cables, onboard sensor fusion, and Dryden wind turbulence, achieving $23.5 \pm 1.5$\,cm payload RMSE at sub-MFLOP per-agent cost.
\end{enumerate}
